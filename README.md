# Joke Factory Project
This is my first full stack project using TypeScript, and also my first time practicing Test-Driven Development (TDD) since the beginning. Through TDD, I'm ensuring that I can produce clean code by regularly refactoring my codebase. 

The Joke Factory project is a simple platform for users to share and read jokes. Users can submit their own jokes, review existing jokes, and leave comments.

## Current Status
I'm still working on the back end, so the project is not yet fully functional. However, I'm making progress and hope to have a working version soon.

## Main Technologies Used
This project is built using the following technologies:
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- React
- Sqlite3 (for test and development)
- PostgreSQL (for production)
